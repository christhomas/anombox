            The <b>international literature festival berlin [ilb]</b> will hold a worldwide reading for freedom of expression and assembly on 9 September 2020. These readings are intended to draw attention to the situation of freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and human rights in Hong Kong.<br/>
            <br/>
            Human rights are enshrined in Hong Kong´s Basic Law. As we witness since last year, in Hongkongers´ exercise of basic rights, there has been a growing compromise of freedom from fear. The world needs to address this turn for the worse. This reading of the <b><i>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</i></b> will vocalize our support for the people in Hong Kong.
